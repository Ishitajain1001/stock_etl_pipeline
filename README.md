This is still a work in progress but I am creating an ETL Pipeline using API data from Alpha Vantage about stocks in order to create a model and potentially a dashboard. As of now, the pipeline manually works but I am working on shifting it with Apache Airflow to automate the process. Due to library dependency inconsistencies I am considering a different approach but am still designing a seamless solution.
